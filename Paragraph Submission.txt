During this project i've learned how to apply implicit operators,
and also grasped the idea of how important objects are within a program
and how they are able to simplify the code. Making objects of Dice, Coin, Card,
and DeckOfCards worked really well with the application of this project. One of the
most challenging aspects was really understanding how implicit operators work 
correctly, and how to override a ToString function correctly. I believe i would
adjust my card class and deck class to have private members, in which shall
apply encapsulation more for better security of the program.
